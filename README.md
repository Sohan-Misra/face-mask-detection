# Face Mask Detection
In this project we create a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model and transfer learning to detect if a person in an image is wearing a face mask.

## Goal:
To better understand the working of Neural Networks and transfer learning.

## Technologies Used:
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow
* Keras

## Steps to run:
* Install python3, necessary libraries and either Jupyter notebook or Jupyter Lab.(Preferably use a <mark>conda</mark> environment)
* Clone this repository on your local device.
* Open the notebook, i.e, <mark>Face_Mask.ipynb</mark> and start executing the cells.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is provided within the repository.
